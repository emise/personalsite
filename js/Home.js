        I study the sky<br />
        As a picture framed by cheap shutter blinds<br />
        Of a museum where I could be<br />
        <br />
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;alone
        <br /><br />
        &emsp;&emsp;luxuriantly alone
        <br /><br />
        If I were a fragment of personality<br />
        &emsp;&emsp;of the cosmic soul<br />
        False are the constructs of being whole<br />
        Like splitting a rope<br />
        &emsp;&emsp;in two<br />
        And tying a knot to make<br />
        &emsp;&emsp;us<br />
        Us?<br />
        <br />
        I could play some music<br />
        &emsp;&emsp;clear and hollow<br />
        To quiver the synapse between me and you<br />
        Then maybe you could feel what I feel<br />
        &emsp;&emsp;what is behind it all and<br />
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;real<br />
        <br /><br />
        But neither you nor me<br />
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;can truly sense the other<br />
        I pretend I am the curator<br />
        &emsp;&emsp;of my world<br />
        You<br />
        &emsp;&emsp;of your world<br />
        <br />
        Perhaps then the sky I ponder<br />
        <br />
        Is only mine<br />
        &emsp;&emsp;to reveal
        </p>
