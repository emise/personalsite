    I study the sky<br />
    As a picture framed by cheap shutter blinds<br />
    Of a museum where I could be<br />
    <br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;alone
    <br /><br />
    &emsp;&emsp;luxuriantly alone
    <br /><br />
    If I were a fragment of personality<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;of the cosmic soul<br />
    False are the constructs of being whole<br />
    Like splitting a rope<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;in two<br />
    And tying a knot to make<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;us<br />
    Us?<br />
    <br />
    I could play some music<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;clear and hollow<br />
    To quiver the synapse between me and you<br />
    Then maybe you could feel what I feel<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;what is behind it all and<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;real<br />
    <br /><br />
    But neither you nor me<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;can truly sense the other<br />
    I pretend I am the curator<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;of my world<br />
    You<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;of your world<br />
    <br />
    Perhaps then the sky I ponder<br />
    <br />
    Is only mine<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;to reveal

    Soft and suffused with <br />
    the aftertaste of sweet minerals<br />
    the air beckons, “drink me,<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;in gulps”<br />
    filling the emptiness where<br />
    we used to dwell<br />
    <br />
    With insistent caresses<br />
    brushing the skin<br />
    a million sparkles of light<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;course through our millions of vessels<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;arousing the body to dash headfirst into<br />
    <br />
    The endless promises<br />
    of reassuring night<br />
    where unrepressed feelings take flight<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;and find their way in muffled<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;sigh<br />
    to give a fleeting glimpse of the swelling<br />
