  title: "drink the air at night",
  htmlText: `
    Soft and suffused with <br />
    the aftertaste of sweet minerals<br />
    the air beckons, “drink me,<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;in gulps”<br />
    filling the emptiness where<br />
    we used to dwell<br />
    <br />
    With insistent caresses<br />
    brushing the skin<br />
    a million sparkles of light<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;course through our millions of vessels<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;arousing the body to dash headfirst into<br />
    <br />
    The endless promises<br />
    of reassuring night<br />
    where unrepressed feelings take flight<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;and find their way in muffled<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;sigh<br />
    to give a fleeting glimpse of the swelling<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;s t r e t c h i n g<br />

    How funny the smallest of comforts can<br />
    make us forget all we stand for<br />
    Like big talk<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;of self-improvement<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;of progress<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;of eating a healthy supper<br />
    Dwindle to a dot<br />
    when succor is before us<br />
    Its heat<br />
    emanating<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;over stiff limbs<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hands that desired to work<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;harder<br />
    Rest with ambitions forgotten<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;cast aside<br />
    All for the sake of enjoying<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;a little longer<br />
    the warm creature comfort

    When jealousy overtakes<br />
    Consumes my heart, it leaves<br />
    A jadeite child<br />
    Whom I allow be<br />
    His tantrum brings forth<br />
    Un-adult-erated<br />
    A purer me

  htmlText: `
    I saw you in January<br />
    You called my name, grasped my hand merrily<br />
    I saw you in March<br />
    Eyes darting, voice bitterly arched<br />
    I saw you in May<br />
    &ldquo;You seem well,&rdquo; I tried to say<br />
    But you just looked away<br />
    I saw you in July<br />
    Straining to hear your replies through the lies<br />
    I saw you in September<br />
    When you could no longer remember<br />
    That I saw you in November<br />
    A shriveled husk of what was once limber<br />
    Asking who I was<br />
    and why was I here<br />
    <br />
    When I see you in January<br />
    I will grasp your hand<br />
    As we dance a rondo to the endless trance.

  title: "this night you glow blueish white",
  htmlText: `
    at night, at night<br />
    under the starry skies<br />
    we look for a place with no light<br />
    so we may see the night<br />
    <br />
    we find an orchard with no fences<br />
    behind a lot, fluorescent lined<br />
    flashing twinkles in our eyes<br />
    blinding in the night<br />
    <br />
    under fixtures we park<br />
    and steal into the dark<br />
    casting backward glances to be sure<br />
    no patrols find our car<br />
    <br />
    silence cackles and rings<br />
    dry grasses prick our thighs<br />
    your skin glows bluish white by the lot lights<br />
    hauntingly, like an aged photograph<br />
    on a magazine epitaph<br />
    <br />
    twirling a desiccant stalk<br />
    in fingers slight and limber<br />
    you miss the meteor trails<br />
    across the faded sable<br />
    <br />
    old friends who meet again<br />
    must soon say our goodbyes<br />
    but this now is for us<br />
    this night, this night

  htmlText: `
    During whole-team practice<br />
    On the wide expanse of uneven grass<br />
    Late summer has not ceded to fall<br />
    Wild geese cackle as they eye us from close by<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;indolent and wary<br />
    <br />
    We find each other<br />
    Growing hazy like apparitions<br />
    Our hands and disc hardly discernible<br />
    (We haven&rsquo;t the skills to feel for it)<br />
    <br />
    I crane my neck upwards from the sideline<br />
    Twilight flushes slowly<br />
    Scattering blushing pink through striated clouds<br />
    <br />
    As if our life were this scene<br />
    A stateless image that happened to be<br />
    Between myself and I<br />
    Yourself and you<br />
    A moment to reference<br />
    <br />
    Before our voices bring us back<br />
    And we head up the hills for supper.

  title: "the picture sky",
  htmlText: `
    I study the sky<br />
    As a picture framed by cheap shutter blinds<br />
    Of a museum where I could be<br />
    <br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;alone
    <br /><br />
    &emsp;&emsp;luxuriantly alone
    <br /><br />
    If I were a fragment of personality<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;of the cosmic soul<br />
    False are the constructs of being whole<br />
    Like splitting a rope<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;in two<br />
    And tying a knot to make<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;us<br />
    Us?<br />
    <br />
    I could play some music<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;clear and hollow<br />
    To quiver the synapse between me and you<br />
    Then maybe you could feel what I feel<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;what is behind it all and<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;real<br />
    <br /><br />
    But neither you nor me<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;can truly sense the other<br />
    I pretend I am the curator<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;of my world<br />
    You<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;of your world<br />
    <br />
    Perhaps then the picture sky<br />
    <br />
    Is only mine<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;to reveal

    Her brain is tangled in a ball of yarn<br />
    as knots flow through blood<br />
    blocking veins to the heart<br />
    <br />
    She grasps a strand and pulls-<br />
    and pulls and pulls and pulls<br />
    unwinding it before her in a pile on the wood<br />
    <br />
    With small handfuls, she swallows<br />
    slowly in small mouthfuls<br />
    drying spit as she fills the void<br />
    left by her unraveling core

  title: "unfair eyes",
  htmlText: `
    Speaking to me with those eyes isn&rsquo;t fair. Eyes like a bottomless well, emanating warm dampness like the aftermath of a summer shower. At this wooden table, you reach out across the dividing median, invading my space. Your hand covers the open flame by my hand, and my eyes follow on instinct, faint fear prickling my consciousness. Surprised that the heat doesn’t burn you, I laugh when I realize your trick - a fake candle. Perhaps I am faking my attention towards you. Perhaps I need to remain in control. But the more you talk, the more I want to hear you talk. So I watch you.
