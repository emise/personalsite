		He lives in the highlight reels<br />
		Each triumph and nadir beautifully revealed<br />
		I smile and sympathize<br />
		With no more to say than a cliche<br />
		&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; as I leave for the street<br />
		A homeless man interjects to ask for coin<br />
		Can the highlight-man see his plight?<br />
		If I offer some change, could I follow him to the other life?<br />
		<br />
		Down the road the fog rolls<br />
		A dog whimpers and car bass rumbles<br />
		She wants to be noticed, yet also ignored<br />
		in her expensive blouse with nowhere to go<br />
		A passing couple glance at each other<br />
		She mutters, &ldquo;What do they want from me?&rdquo;<br />
		presumptuous and fearful of what they imagine<br />
		<br />
		A grounded pigeon commands the pedestrian give way<br />
		Tip-toeing aside at the last, it looks full of indignation<br />
		The gentleman thinks he is in the wrong<br />
		So he shuffles with his head down<br />
		while he drags his feet up<br />
		to face his mountain ahead<br />
		<br />
		Golden canyons lie in wait around the corner<br />
		Lush forests too, upon no close inspection<br />
		Bison plains and Scandanavian meadows<br />
		Simulacrum worlds for every whim and fancy<br />
		A dream to bomb down those hills like they&rsquo;re not real<br />
		What are rumble strips but another level, a new challenge<br />
		For the kids who live to see another day<br />
		<br />
		Stumbling north, the wind blows east<br />
		Turning east, the wind cuts west<br />
		The dry leaves and leaflets in their incessant death rattle<br />
		Spread out a path, Hansel and Gretel-like<br />
		To delight or to ruin, who can say<br />
		&ldquo;There is no greater thrill than what you bring to me&rdquo; is how it goes<br />
		I shudder in the cold<br />
		<br />
		I retreat to the magic of old abodes<br />
		Where indoor air sees nothing of turbulent change<br />
		Centuries of dust and spores gather<br />
		Seeping into the throat like an insidious reminder<br />
		&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t the first, but you could be the last&rdquo;<br />
		A die for the fireworks to cast<br />
		<br />
		As if to reassure<br />
		Man-made earthquakes break the dawn<br />
		Metallic lattices tendril like bougainvilleas up aged facades<br />
		Asphalt crumbles, then sprouts anew<br />
		A wordless chant ring through the air<br />
		Banish peace to thwart destruction<br />
		<br />
		And yet, lightning bolts make cracks on the empyrean roof<br />
		Momentary branching forests alight above and below<br />
		As the winds of change come a-blowing<br />
		The air burns, choking our sheltered dignity<br />
		Do we mourn or hope for a new Creation?<br />
		Enter Nature against so-called Progress<br />
		However we go, we go together<br />
		<br />
		The turkey vulture circles overhead, vigilant for a sign<br />
		Now is the time to drown<br />
		Not in the Pacific riptides<br />
		Not in the cliffs of the Bay<br />
		In the depth of the endless hills, the converted Victorian condos, the Mexican bush sage,<br />
		the African lilies, the refuse-strewn walkways, the aromatic holes-in-the-wall, the overgrown ficus, the sweet jasmine, the street tents and the souls inside, the Angel's trumpets, the unleashed dogs, the drooping jacarandas, the queues for creameries, the sizzling hotdog carts, the wild nasturtiums, the blackberry brambles, the revving engines and crepuscule fog<br />
		Submerge so those eagle eyes cannot find you<br />
		Not to flee, but to stay<br />

  htmlText: `
    Soft and suffused with <br />
    the aftertaste of sweet minerals<br />
    the air beckons, “drink me,<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;in gulps”<br />
    filling the emptiness where<br />
    we used to dwell<br />
    <br />
    With insistent caresses<br />
    brushing the skin<br />
    a million sparkles of light<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;course through our millions of vessels<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;arousing the body to dash headfirst into<br />
    <br />
    The endless promises<br />
    of reassuring night<br />
    where unrepressed feelings take flight<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;and find their way in muffled<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;sigh<br />
    to give a fleeting glimpse of the swelling<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;s t r e t c h i n g<br />

    How funny the smallest of comforts can<br />
    make us forget all we stand for<br />
    Like big talk<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;of self-improvement<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;of progress<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;of eating a healthy supper<br />
    Dwindle to a dot<br />
    when succor is before us<br />
    Its heat<br />
    emanating<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;over stiff limbs<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hands that desired to work<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;harder<br />
    Rest with ambitions forgotten<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;cast aside<br />
    All for the sake of enjoying<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;a little longer<br />
    the warm creature comfort

    When jealousy overtakes<br />
    Consumes my heart, it leaves<br />
    A jadeite child<br />
    Whom I allow be<br />
    His tantrum brings forth<br />
    Un-adult-erated<br />
    A purer me

    at night, at night<br />
    under the starry skies<br />
    we look for a place with no light<br />
    so we may see the night<br />
    <br />
    we find an orchard with no fences<br />
    behind an empty lot, fluorescent lined<br />
    flashing twinkles in our eyes<br />
    blinding in the night<br />
    <br />
    under fixtures we park<br />
    and steal into the dark<br />
    casting backward glances to be sure<br />
    no patrols find our car<br />
    <br />
    silence cackles and rings<br />
    dry grasses prick our thighs<br />
    your skin glows bluish white by the lot lights<br />
    hauntingly, like an aged photograph<br />
    on a magazine epitaph<br />
    <br />
    twirling a desiccant stalk<br />
    in fingers slight and limber<br />
    you miss the meteor trails<br />
    across the faded sable<br />
    <br />
    old friends who meet again<br />
    must soon say our goodbyes<br />
    but this now is for us<br />
    this night, this night

    During whole-team practice<br />
    On the wide expanse of uneven grass<br />
    Late summer has not ceded to fall<br />
    Wild geese cackle as they eye us from close by<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;indolent and wary<br />
    <br />
    We find each other<br />
    Growing hazy like apparitions<br />
    Our hands and disc hardly discernible<br />
    (We haven&rsquo;t the skills to feel for it)<br />
    <br />
    I crane my neck upwards from the sideline<br />
    Twilight flushes slowly<br />
    Scattering blushing pink through striated clouds<br />
    <br />
    As if our life were this scene<br />
    A stateless image that happened to be<br />
    Between myself and I<br />
    Yourself and you<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Before our voices bring us back<br />
    And we head up the hills for supper.

    I study the sky<br />
    As a picture framed by cheap shutter blinds<br />
    Of a museum where I could be<br />
    <br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;alone
    <br /><br />
    &emsp;&emsp;luxuriantly alone
    <br /><br />
    If I were a fragment of personality<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;of the cosmic soul<br />
    False are the constructs of being whole<br />
    Like splitting a rope<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;in two<br />
    And tying a knot to make<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;us<br />
    Us?<br />
    <br />
    I could play some music<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;clear and hollow<br />
    To quiver the synapse between me and you<br />
    Then maybe you could feel what I feel<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;what is behind it all and<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;real<br />
    <br /><br />
    But neither you nor me<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;can truly sense the other<br />
    I pretend I am the curator<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;of my world<br />
    You<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;of your world<br />
    <br />
    Perhaps then the picture sky<br />
    <br />
    Is only mine<br />
    &emsp;&emsp;to reveal

    Her brain is tangled in a ball of yarn<br />
    as knots flow through bloodstreams<br />
    blocking veins to the heart<br />
    <br />
    She grasps a strand and pulls-<br />
    and pulls and pulls and pulls<br />
    unwinding before her in a pile on wood<br />
    <br />
    With small handfuls, she swallows<br />
    slowly in small mouthfuls<br />
    spit drying as she fills<br />
    the remaining void

  htmlText: `
    Speaking to me with those eyes isn&rsquo;t fair. Eyes like a bottomless well, emanating warm dampness like the aftermath of a summer shower. At this wooden table, you reach out across the dividing median, invading my space. Your hand covers the open flame by my hand, and my eyes follow on instinct, faint fear prickling my consciousness. Surprised that the heat doesn’t burn you, I laugh when I realize your trick - a fake candle. Perhaps I am faking my attention towards you. Perhaps I need to remain in control. But the more you talk, the more I want to hear you talk. So I watch you.
